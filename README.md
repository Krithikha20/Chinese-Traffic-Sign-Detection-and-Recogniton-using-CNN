# Chinese-Traffic-Sign-Detection-and-Recogniton-using-CNN
Abstract : Traffic sign recognition system plays a crucial role in the automatic driving systems for traffic assistance. It helps to identify traffic signs more effectively. Many initiatives were conducted to upgrade the models to meet the requirements of real-time road problems. A convolutional neural net approach has been used in this project to detect and recognize the image of traffic signs.
- Chinese Traffic Sign dataset includes 6164 traffic sign images containing 58 sign categories. 
- The images are divided into two sub-databases as training database and testing database. 
- The training database includes 4170 images while the testing one contains 1994 images.
